# smart-street-light-IOT-Smoke-monitoring-System
An IOT based Smart street light with various applications

Our proposed system consists of smart street lights that have external light sensing 
that automatically turns on at desired intensity based on the amount of lighting 
needed. The system also allows us to detect the smoke in various places and raises an alert 
Along with the light sensor (LDR) we also  worked with Ultrasonic sensor 
(HCSR-04) or PIR sensor which are used to sense and detect the objects in their 
range. 
if a person stands under the light more than the limited time then it will gives an alert and this application can be used for 
various scenarios in the real time
